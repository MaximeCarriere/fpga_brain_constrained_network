Python Scripts for Execution and Validation
===========================================

This directory contains the Python scripts necessary to interact with the FPGA hardware and to validate its output against the NEST software model.

ðŸš€ Key Scripts
--------------

### 1\. run\_fpga\_sim.py (or run\_step\_feedback.py)

This script is run on the **PYNQ-Z1 board** to execute the single-neuron simulation.

*   **Function:** Loads the FPGA bitstream (system\_i\_wrapper.bit), initializes neuron parameters via AXI-Lite registers, and executes the simulation loop step-by-step on the hardware.
    
*   **Output:** Generates trace.csv containing the time-series data ($V\_m$, $I\_{ext}$, and $S\_{spike}$) from the FPGA.
    

### 2\. run\_nest\_sim.py

This script is run on a **host machine** with the NEST Simulator installed.

*   **Function:** Executes the same IAF-PSC-EXP model with identical parameters and input currents as the FPGA simulation.
    
*   **Output:** Generates nest\_single\_neuron.csv for use as the validation "gold standard."
    

### 3\. plot\_comparison.py

This script is run on a **host machine** to analyze results.

*   **Function:** Loads both the FPGA's trace.csv and NEST's nest\_single\_neuron.csv, synchronizes their time axes, and generates a visual comparison plot to verify hardware fidelity.
    

âœ… Validation Plot
-----------------

The primary output of the validation process is this comparison plot, generated by plot\_comparison.py. The close overlap confirms that the FPGA's fixed-point implementation accurately matches the NEST float-point reference model.
